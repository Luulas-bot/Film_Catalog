# Film Catalog
## About this project
   
   The main idea of the project is to create a program with the objective o keeping track of all the movies you have seen, you want to watch, or perhaps you didn't like at all.
Summarising, a catalog of your personal movies to solve the problem when someone asks you *Do you have any movies to recommend?*.

### What offers you this program?

- First of all. The program uses a login and sign-up function connected to an `SQL Server`. This means every user has his own movies, and there are no chances that other users can see what you saved in you personal catalog.
- The interface is pretty simple to use.
- You can add all the movies you want and these will be saved just with one click
- The movies can be edited easily.
- For long catalogs of movies, there is always the option of using filters. There are a bunch of those, *to watch*, *already seen*, *country*, etc...

### The language
   The language the program is written on is `python`. The reason for that is because is a simple language and it has a great module called `SQL Alchemy` which is great to manage your `Database`.
   
### Can you download this program in you computer?
   Unfortunatly, there is no way for me to distribute this program for anyone to use it. The reason for that is mainly beacuse the program, as said previously, works with a `Database` that runs in my computer with the `SQL Server`. Which means that the program only works using my `SQL Server`. Big programs, proects or games that need a `Database`, get a server in which they can build one. That is not my case.

There is also the problem that i run the program from the sript. Even if i could create an `.exe` file, it would only work for `Windows`.

Despite all I said previously, I made a `requirments.txt` where anybody who wants to, can see what i used to build the program.    

   
### A quick overview of the story of this project
  At the beginning, the project had no proper shape. It wasn't a Film Catalog, it just was a program which had to work with `Databases`. the reason for that is pretty simple, I recently learned deep **SQL** things, and i wanted to test my knowledge building something quite complex (at least for me).
  
### If it cannot be tested, where can I see how it works?
  Soon I will make a little webpage where I will upload all of my projects with some photos of how it works and some explanations. Hope these codes will be useful for you or anybody for somwthing!
